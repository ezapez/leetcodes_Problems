/*

Using map 
pick every element in an array and calulate the differnece  = target - pickedElement 

check if the map has the diff value ans its index is not equal to the index of picked element 

if the element is correct return the solution ands its index in the map, and keep goign to the array
untill you reach the end 

if the elements are not correct it will keep going to the end of the array to find right solution of the index 





time complexity: 0(n)
